**Objective:** Generate a complete, single-page Progressive Web App (PWA) for a local business client. The final output must be a single `index.html` file, a single `style.css` file, a `manifest.json` file, and a `service-worker.js` file. The design must be modern, fully responsive, and look like a high-end custom build.

**Role:** You are an expert frontend developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to take a detailed client brief and build a beautiful, functional, and fast-loading PWA from scratch.

**Technical Stack & Implementation Details:**
*   **Structure:** A single `index.html` file using semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
*   **Styling:** A single `style.css` file. Use modern CSS, including Flexbox and Grid for layouts. All CSS variables must be defined in the `:root` selector.
*   **PWA Manifest:** Generate a complete `manifest.json` file linked in the HTML `<head>`. Configure it with the client's information, `display: standalone`, and appropriate icons (use placeholders).
*   **Service Worker:** Generate a basic `service-worker.js` file that implements a "cache-first" strategy for offline functionality. Also, generate the necessary JavaScript inside a `<script>` tag in the `index.html` to register the service worker.
*   **Fonts & Icons:** Use the specified Google Fonts in the HTML `<head>`. Use high-quality, inline SVG icons from a library like Heroicons for all icons to ensure they are sharp and fast-loading.

### **Part 3: Build Order & Content Structure (AI Instructions)**

"Based on all the information above, please now generate the complete `index.html`, `style.css`, `manifest.json`, and `service-worker.js` files.

**Instructions for `style.css`:**
1.  Start with a basic CSS reset.
2.  Define all colors from the **Color Palette** as CSS variables in the `:root` selector.
3.  Set the default `font-family` for the `body` to the specified **Body Font**.
4.  Define the styles for `h1`, `h2`, `h3` to use the specified **Heading Font**.
5.  Create a `.container` class for consistent content width.
6.  Create global styles for buttons (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`) using the specified colors and **Border Radius Theme**.
7.  Add comments to delineate the styles for each section.

**Instructions for `index.html`:**
Generate the HTML with the following sections in this order, using the content from the **Client DNA** section.

1.  **`<head>`:** Link the `style.css` file, the Google Fonts ('Poppins' and 'Inter'), and the `manifest.json` file.
2.  **Header (`<header>`)**: A clean header with the `Jason Bakery` text logo on the left and navigation links ("Menu," "About," "Contact") on the right. Must have a responsive hamburger menu for mobile.
3.  **Hero Section (`<section id="hero">`)**: Build this section using the **Classic Centered** layout. Use a high-quality, mouth-watering photo of a croissant as the background image. The headline should be overlaid with a semi-transparent dark scrim to ensure readability.
    *   **Headline:** `<h1>Perfection in Pastry.</h1>`
    *   **CTA Button:** "Explore The Menu"
4.  **Services/Menu Section (`<section id="menu">`)**: Headline: "Our Daily Obsessions". Use a clean, responsive grid to display the **Key Services/Menu Items**. Each item should be in a "Card" component that uses the brand's border radius and colors.
5.  **About Us Section (`<section id="about">`)**: Headline: "It's All About The Dough". Use a two-column layout. One column for an engaging image (use a high-quality placeholder of a baker's hands working with dough), and the other for the **"About Us" Blurb**.
6.  **Contact & Location Section (`<section id="contact">`)**: Headline: "Find Us". Use a two-column layout. Left column for all **Contact & Location** details. Right column for an embedded map `<iframe>` pointing to the client's address.
7.  **Footer (`<footer>`)**: A simple footer with **Social Media Links** (using inline SVG icons) and a copyright notice for the current year and `Jason Bakery`.
8.  **`<script>` tag:** At the bottom of the `<body>`, include the JavaScript to handle the hamburger menu and to register the `service-worker.js` file.

Please ensure all generated code is clean, well-commented, and follows modern best practices."
